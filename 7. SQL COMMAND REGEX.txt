USING REGEX OPERATORas a regular expression matching if you want to match any city that contains the 
substring "field" anywhere in its name this is the querry:

- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city REGEX 'field';
you can use LIKE operator for example:
- SELECT * FROM customer WHERE city LIKE '%field%';
The REGEXP operator uses regular expressions for more complex pattern matching, while LIKE
 uses simple wildcard patterns (e.g., % for any sequence of characters) for basic substring matching.

For REGEX we have ^ symbol represents the start of a string
for example :
Retrieves all cities that start with "New"
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city REGEXP '^New';
Retrieves all customers whose first names start with letter "A"
- SELECT first_name FROM customers WHERE city REGEXP '^A';
Retieves all customers whose cities is not uppercase letter
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city REGEXP '^[^A-Z]';
Explanation of ^[^A-Z]
The first ^ indicates the start of the string.
Inside the brackets [], the caret ^ negates the characters specified, meaning it matches any character that is not included in the brackets.
For example:
[abc] matches a single character that is either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
[a-z] matches any single lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.

[^abc] matches any character that is not 'a', 'b', or 'c'. abc uppercase letter will include If you want to ensure
that uppercase 'A', 'B', and 'C' are also excluded from the match, you can use the pattern 
[^abcABC] in sql SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city REGEXP '^[^abcABC]

[A-Za-z] matches any single uppercase or lowercase letter.
Thus, in the example ^[^A-Z], the query retrieves cities where the first character is not an uppercase letter (i.e., not A-Z).

$ this symbol represent the end of the string 
for example:
retrieve all cities from the customers that ends with field
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city REGEXP 'field$';

To retrieve data that contains specific substrings in the last_name field, you can use the REGEXP 
operator with the pipe symbol (|), which acts as an OR operator in regular expressions.
To retrieve customers whose last names contain either "field" or "mac", you would write the SQL query 
like this:
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field|mac';

How about we combine our learnings 
Lets try to retrieve all customer records where the last name starts with the substrings 'field', 'mac', or 'rose', you can use the following SQL query:
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP '^(field|mac|rose)';

Lets retrieve all customers whose last names contains substring with 'g', 'i', or 'm' followed by the letter 'e'
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e';
[gim]e: This pattern matches any substring in the last_name that contains a character 'g', 'i', or 'm' immediately followed by 'e'.

retrieve all customers data where substring should contain any character from 'a' to 'z' anywhere in the last name, followed specifically by the letter 'e
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-z]e'

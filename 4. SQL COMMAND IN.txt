TABLE: customers
short of combining multiple condition of OR operator
example:
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = 'VA' OR state = 'FL' OR 'GA'
instead of this code we use IN operator
- SELECT * FROM customer WHERE state IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')
this will execute a same result

we can use NOT operator
- SELECT * FROM customer WHERE state NOT IN ('VA', 'FL', 'GA')

table: products
return the products in quantity in stock equal to 49,38,72
-SELECT * FROM products WHERE quantity_in_stock IN(49, 38, 72)

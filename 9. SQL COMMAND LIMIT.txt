The LIMIT clause in SQL is used to specify the maximum number of records to return from a query. 
It's particularly useful when you want to control the amount of data retrieved, especially in cases
where the dataset might be large. Here are some common uses for LIMIT:

When you only need a specific number of records, 
LIMIT helps avoid retrieving unnecessary data. For example, 

if you're only interested in the top 10 highest sales, you could use:
- SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10;

LIMIT is often combined with OFFSET to implement pagination in applications. 
This allows users to view data in chunks. For example, to get records 11 to 20:
- SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

ANOTHER EXAMPLE WITH EXPLANTION
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id LIMIT 0, 5;

Explanation:
SELECT *: This part of the query indicates that you want to select all columns from the customers table.

FROM customers: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data, which is the customers table.

ORDER BY customer_id: This clause sorts the results based on the customer_id column. By default, 
sorting is done in ascending order (from the smallest to the largest value).

LIMIT 0, 5: The LIMIT clause restricts the number of records returned by the query. In this case:

0 indicates the starting point (the first record).
5 specifies the maximum number of records to return.
So, this will return the first 5 records from the sorted result.
Summary:
The entire query retrieves the first 5 customers from the customers table, ordered by their customer_id. 
If there are fewer than 5 records in the table, it will return all available records.

This kind of query is useful for implementing pagination or simply when you want to limit the amount of
 data returned for performance reasons.

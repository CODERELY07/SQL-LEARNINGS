cre"The primary key of the table is defined by default to ensure uniqueness for each record."

To sort the customers table by the first_name column in ascending order, use:
- SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY first_name;

To sort by first_name in descending order, use:
- SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY first_name DESC;

o sort by multiple columns, you can list them in the ORDER BY clause.
 For instance, to sort by state and then by first_name, use:
- SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY state, first_name;

To sort the results of the customers table by state in descending order and 
then by first_name in ascending order, you can modify your SQL query as follows:
- SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY state DESC, first_name;


Note:
When sorting by multiple columns, the order of the columns in the ORDER BY clause affects the final result. 
Sorting by state, first_name first organizes the results by state and then, within each state, sorts by 
first_name. Conversely, sorting by first_name, state will first organize the results by first_name and then
group the records with the same first_name by state. Always choose the order based on your specific 
sorting needs.


Problem Scenario:
Context: You are working for an online retail company that manages customer orders. 
The company has a database with a table named order_items that stores details about each item in an order.

Table Structure: The order_items table has the following columns:

order_id (integer): The ID of the order.
item_id (integer): The ID of the item.
quantity (integer): The number of units of the item ordered.
unit_price (decimal): The price per unit of the item.
Task: You need to analyze the order with order_id = 2.
 Your goal is to find out which items in this order generated the highest total cost.

Requirements:

Calculate the total cost for each item by multiplying quantity by unit_price.
Retrieve all details for the items in this order.
Sort the results in descending order based on the total cost.

Solution:

SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total 
FROM order_items 
WHERE order_id = 2 
ORDER BY total DESC;

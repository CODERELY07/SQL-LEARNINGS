The `LIKE` operator in SQL is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern 
in a column. It is particularly useful for matching string values where you want to find 
partial matches, using wildcards like `%` (any sequence of characters) and `_` (a single character). 
You would use `LIKE` when you need flexible string matching, such as finding names that start with 
a certain letter or include a specific substring.

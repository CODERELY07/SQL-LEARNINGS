show number of points between 1000 to 3000
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points >= 1000 AND points <= 3000

We can use another opartor which is BETWEEN for clean code
- SELECT * FROM customers WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000

use between for dates
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01'
 AND '2000-01-01';
